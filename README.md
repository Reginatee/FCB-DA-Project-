# FCB-DA-Project
## Documentation 
In this project, I aim to harness the power of data analysis to develop a comprehensive and actionable plan based on participant feedback. I collected detailed expectations and goals from class participants through surveys and feedback forms, then meticulously analyzed them to identify similar preferences and categorize these insights into meaningful themes. The primary objective is to translate these analytical insights into a strategic project plan that meets the needs and expectations of the participants. This guide is instrumental in shaping the project and ensuring it aligns with the participants' expectations. The final deliverable includes a comprehensive report summarizing my findings, along with categorized recommendations that reflect the students' feedback. This approach not only ensures that their expectations are met but also highlights the importance of data analysis in driving project success and participant satisfaction.
