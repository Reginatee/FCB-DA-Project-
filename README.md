# FCB-DA-Project
## Documentation 
#In this project, I aim to harness the power of data analysis to develop a comprehensive and actionable plan based on participant feedback. I will begin by collecting detailed expectations and goals from class participants through surveys and feedback forms. Once I gather this data, I will meticulously analyze it to identify key trends, preferences, and areas for improvement.

# My primary objective is to translate these analytical insights into a strategic project plan that meets the needs and expectations of the participants. The final deliverable will include a detailed report summarizing my findings, along with a set of recommendations and an actionable project roadmap. This process will not only ensure that participant feedback is effectively utilized but also demonstrate the critical role of data analysis in informed decision-making and project success.
