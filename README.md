# FCB-DA-Project
## Documentation 
In this project, I aim to harness the power of data analysis to develop a comprehensive and actionable plan based on participant feedback. I collected detailed expectations and goals from class participants through surveys and feedback forms, then meticulously analyzed them to identify similar preferences. My primary objective is to translate these analytical insights into a strategic project plan that meets the needs and expectations of the participants. The final deliverable will include a detailed report summarizing my findings, recommendations, and an actionable project roadmap. This process will ensure that participant feedback is effectively utilized and demonstrate the critical role of data analysis in informed decision-making and project success.
